HAOS REDRO PN: 0000.0104
========================

This is a 1.2kW SMPS for audio amplifiers designed to fit within a 1U case.

Input: 400V DC
Output 1: +100V, 6A
Output 2: -100V, 6A
Output 3: +15V, 500mA
Output 4: -15V, 500mA
Output 5: +12V, 1A
Output 6: +12V, 500mA, referenced to Output 2.

The main outputs are unregulated and it is reccomended to use a suitable power factor correction circuit in applications where line regulation is necessary.
Auxiliary outputs 3 and 4 are provided for small-signal curcuits. Output 6 is provided for class-D amplifiers that require a gate drive supply referenced to the negative supply rail. 
Isolated and non-isolated inputs are provided to shut down the converter on J10 and J11, respectively. Oveheating protection is provided by a thermostat mounted on the heatsink.
